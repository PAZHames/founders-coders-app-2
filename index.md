            <div class="paragraph section-conten top-para">My name is Phoebe. I have loved the last 8 years working as an actor and teacher, but when the pandemic hit so did reality and I made the ultimately very freeing decision to move away from an industry that was no longer serving me. I have always been a keen problem solver and although I loved acting, it lacks the ability to consistently work on and fix problems.

                    <li>âœ¨  Won Second Place ðŸ¥ˆ at my first <strong>Hackathon</strong>  (Athena 2023 - Europeâ€™s biggest hackathon for women and non-binary people) at which I had to present pretty much solo!</li>
                    <li>âœ¨  Built a series of projects using HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and Python, working both alone and as part of a team (I am particularly pleased with my Code First Girls team's Pokemon Top Trumps).</li>
                    <li>âœ¨  Got involved with various projects coming out of Newspeak House to bring together my burgeoning technical skill and political beliefs, especially in the face of the upcoming election.</li>
                    <li>âœ¨  Had deeply informative tech beers with people whose careers I admire, and learnt a huge amount from each.</li>

            <div class="paragraph section-content">My experience as a teacher has helped my coding journey hugely. My learning style is such that I master topics by explaining them. It has also forced me for the first time in a long time to take some of the advice I dish out on a daily basis; starting before I feel ready and making as many mistakes as possible; being bold and breaking my code if needs be, not holding onto one solution just because it functions, but always exploring further.

            <div class="paragraph section-content">In my free time, I go to a lot of exhibitions, both at galleries and museums. During my Masters at King's, I took a module in â€˜Digitising Cultural Heritageâ€™, which was one of the impetuses for learning to code. I found the discussions around open source data and who owns digital content compelling and wanted to contribute practically to the discussion, beyond my education in Classics. I explored digital solutions to accessibility in cultural heritage and for my final project, I used the platform Historypin to create an accessible audio tour of the City of Londonâ€™s monstrous statues. <a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.historypin.org/en/monstrous-statues-of-the-city-of-london-2/geo/51.507351,-0.127758,11/bounds/51.340369,-0.308346,51.673724,0.05283/paging/1/pin/1155337">Find it here!</a>

    <div class="paragraph section-content">As such, on a bit of a whim, I picked up a coding intro with SheCodes about a year ago. And I was hooked. I have not found flow like that in any other part of my life for years and it is addictive. I now finish each day with my brain aching but I am so, so happy.

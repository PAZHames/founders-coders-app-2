            <div class="paragraph section-content">My name is Phoebe. I have loved the last 8 years working as an actor and teacher, but when the pandemic hit so did reality and I made the ultimately very freeing decision to move away from an industry that was no longer serving me. I have always been a keen problem solver and although I loved acting, it lacks the ability to consistently work on and fix problems.

                    <li>âœ¨  Won Second Place ðŸ¥ˆ at my first <strong>Hackathon</strong>  (Athena 2023 - Europeâ€™s biggest hackathon for women and non-binary people)</li>
                    <li>âœ¨  Built a series of projects using HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and Python, working both alone and as part of a team (I am particularly pleased with my team's Pokemon Top Trumps).</li>
                    <li>âœ¨  Got involved with various projects coming out of Newspeak House to bring together my burgeoning technical skill and political beliefs, especially in the face of the upcoming election</li>
                    <li>âœ¨  Had deeply informative tech beers with people whose careers I admire, and learnt a huge amount from each.</li>

    <div class="paragraph section-content">I realised I needed more tangible gains and momentum in my life. In my free time, I go to a lot of exhibitions, both art and museum and during my Masters, I took a module in â€˜Digitising Cultural Heritageâ€™, which was one of the impetuses for learning to code. I found the discussions around open source data and who owns digital content fascinating and wanted to contribute practically to this discussion, beyond my education in Classics.

    <div class="paragraph section-content">As such, on a bit of a whim, I picked up a coding intro with SheCodes about a year ago. And I was hooked. I have not found flow like that in any other part of my life for years and it is addictive. I now finish each day with my brain aching but I am so, so happy.

                For the last few years and along with my partner, Daniel, I have been carer for my Grandma who raised me, so making sure sheâ€™s happy, fed and engaged takes up a worthwhile chunk of my time.

                Outside of this, I cook (I am too excitable for a signature dish, but I do a mean â€˜big saladâ€™), garden (Iâ€™m actually now quite good at this and severely over-invested in the wellbeing of my tomatoes) and I am in an impressively long-running book club.

            <div class="card-para">
                Having completed my Undergraduate degree in Classics at the University of Oxford, my bread and butter for the next 8 years was working as a homeschooling teacher. I specialise in homeschooling neurodivergent teenage girls for whom mainstream education is not offering the support they require. I am as much a mentor as I am a teacher and have historically been described as 'quite mad but absolutely brilliant'; which I take as a huge compliment.

                After 5 years of teaching, I undertook a part-time Masters at King's College London. One of my papers there was on Digitising Cultural Heritage; providing digital solutions to help people access or keep hold of their own cultural heritage, and to provide access to those who might otherwise be left out. This course opened my mind hugely, inspiring me to try coding. My final project for this paper was an accessible guide of the City of London's monsters and can be found
